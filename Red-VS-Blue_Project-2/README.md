In the second project week, we worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which we assumed the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, we were to attack a vulnerable VM within our environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, we then used Kibana to review logs taken during the Day 1 engagement. We used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for this report.
Then, we were to interpret this log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that we successfully performed.
