# Final Project
In this project, we were to act as security engineer/penetration tester, supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team/Red Team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working.
If the alerts are working, we were to then monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. Then, we reported back our findings to the manager with appropriate analysis.
